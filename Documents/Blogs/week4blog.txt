Week 4:
I am currently working on getting accurate colour data for my machine learning model to use later. 

I need to get this data swiftly and identify the grain ideally in under a second to be used for industrial purposes. 

I need a list of possible features and points of interest to gather data from. 

Currently the main 3 I have are:

- Colour: by getting sample points on the grain I can retrieve a colour value and by using machine learning teach the model 
	which colour is closest to which type of grain.
	
- Shape: the grains are different in shape and I can obtain an outline by using computer vision techniques, the simplest 
	being contour detection. Using the outline I can calculate how close this shape is to a circle and in the machine 
	learning model determine what 
	
- Area: this is the least impactful because the area can be different depending on the camera location. Even though with 
	training data I will be able to identify the sizes closest to a type of grain, the camera location is what impact 
	this data the most. The camera usually will not be in a constant location and will be prone to even slight movements 
	disrupting the data. This is a simple calculation which I can use for early testing. Since this could be a good data 
	point I a solution to the problem of camera movements would be to instead of training the area before, to train the 
	area actively as the machine learning model is working. 
	
- Length â€“ Width or aspect ratio: This is a data point that simply gets the length of the grain and puts it up against the
	width in a ratio value. This is a value not affected by camera movements or changes in the image. 
	
- Key feature - hairy ends: Classifying wholegrain can be improved with the addition of detecting the hair on the ends of the grain.
