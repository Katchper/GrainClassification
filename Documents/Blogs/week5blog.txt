Week 5:

Colour Space Research:
HSV vs RGB
RGB is the collection of 3 colour levels for a pixel from 0 - 255 for the R, G and B.

HSV is different in where the H is Hue, S is satuation and V is value or brightness.
This makes it easier for detecting specific colour ranges in any lighting conditions because the hue
is seperated from the other two dictating the brightness/darkness of the pixel.
Hue is 0-360 with the colour spectrum represented in a circle.

In openCV these are different with, hue range being [0,179], saturation range is [0,255], and value range is [0,255]


HSV can be observed to look for specific colour hue ranges within the image while RGB will be used more specifically
for hard machine learning
