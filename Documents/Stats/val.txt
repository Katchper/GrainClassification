preprocessing is step 1

improving the threshold to include the darker pixels on the grain, brightness + contrast needs tweaking
threshold values

canny edge detection to seperate the grains

fill the contours


brightness contrast: 319, 175
299, 172
test canny edge: 280 155


methods tested: 
sobel edge detection
canny edge + erosion + adding together with original
